‘Ek Machhali Paani Mein Gayi Chappak’: This viral game is trending on Instagram

The game can be played with many people, first, ask all players to form a circle. 
One member of the group starts by saying “Ek machhali.” The next member needs to enact and say, “Paani mein gayi.” The third member continues with a clap and says, “Chappak.” 
But this is not it. The game continues with the fourth member who carries forward the fun with “Do machchali.” now the next player has to say it again "Do Machchali" and next would say "Panani mein gayi."
the game continues like this and after each iternation is completed the word call frequence increases.

As much as fun this game sounds, it also has ground rules. The member who fumbles—forgetting the counting—is thrown out of the game.
